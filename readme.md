# Code Samples

This repo contains a number of samples I was asked to provide for various interviews and tests.  Feel free to check them out.  Each test was completed within a short timescale and has various special criteria.

## dotnet-basic-adonet

This is a simple project that implements user management in C#, but without using any ORM.  The criteria was to use basic ADO.Net to show an understanding of databases & SQL.

## native-javascript

This is a sample project that downloads two CSV files and displays the results in the form of a ticker.  The criteria was to use native javascript with some animations.

## sudoku-nodejs

This is a simple Sudoku solver I wrote in about 30 minutes using
nodejs, as an attempt to build a simple heuristic algorithm in
node.
